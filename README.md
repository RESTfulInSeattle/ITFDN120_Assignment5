Reverse a single linked list.

Add several integer nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Then display the list so it outputs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (or something similar)

Then reverse the linked list.

Then display the list again so it displays: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

There are several ways to reverse a linked list.

Use recursion - but this uses the stack unnecessarily

Create a second list and always add the elements at the head

Modify the list in place
